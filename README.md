When you set up a Socket.io server using Node.js and integrate it with your Express application, the Socket.io library automatically serves its client-side JavaScript at the `/socket.io/socket.io.js` path relative to the server root.

When your HTML page includes the line:

```html
<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
```

It fetches the Socket.io client-side JavaScript from the server that your Socket.io (Node.js) server is running on. The client-side script allows you to create a socket connection to the server using `io()`.

So, even though you don't have the `/socket.io/socket.io.js` file in your project's directory, your Socket.io server serves this file automatically. That's why it works.

To clarify, this happens because the Socket.io library is designed to automatically host its client-side script for you, making it easy to get started without having to include the script manually in your project. When you set up your Socket.io server, it essentially also sets up a route that serves the client-side Socket.io library when requested from `/socket.io/socket.io.js`.
