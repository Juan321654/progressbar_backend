     <!-- When you set up a Socket.io server using Node.js and integrate it with your 
     Express application, the Socket.io library automatically serves its client-side 
     JavaScript at the /socket.io/socket.io.js path relative to the server root. -->

     <!-- To clarify, this happens because the Socket.io library is designed to automatically 
     host its client-side script for you, making it easy to get started without having 
     to include the script manually in your project. When you set up your Socket.io server, 
     it essentially also sets up a route that serves the client-side Socket.io library when 
     requested from /socket.io/socket.io.js. -->
